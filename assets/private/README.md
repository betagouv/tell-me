# Private Assets

This folder holds **private** survey entries-related uploaded files.

These assets are programmatically served via the `/pages/api/asset.js` controller since it's
[impossible](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/static-file-serving) to use Next.js Static File Serving for assets
created at runtime.
